# My Dart & Flutter Learning Journey

## Purpose

I started learning Dart and Flutter in February 2025 to enhance my skills in mobile app development. This repository serves as a documented journey of my learning process, containing code examples, exercises, and projects I complete along the way.

## Lessons Overview

### Current Progress

- **Lesson One**:

  - [variable type](./lessonOne/types_variable.dart)
  - [List/Array in dart]("./lessonOne/List.dart")
  - [Map/Object in dart]("./lessonOne/Map.dart")
  - [Set in dart]("./lessonOne/Set.dart")

- Lesson Two: [inprogress]

### Planned Curriculum

_This section will be updated as I progress through different topics and lessons_

## How to Navigate

Each lesson is contained in its own directory, named sequentially (lessonOne, lessonTwo, etc.). Within each lesson directory, you'll find:

- Source code files
- Exercise solutions
- Notes and documentation
- Mini-projects (if applicable)

## Learning Resources

_To be added as I discover helpful resources during my learning journey_

## Goals

- Master Dart programming fundamentals
